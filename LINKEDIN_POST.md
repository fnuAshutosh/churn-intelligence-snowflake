Here are three templates for your LinkedIn post. Choose the one that best fits your personal brand voice.

## Option 1: The "Engineering Standard" (Best for Senior/Platform Roles)
**Headline:** Stop building static dashboards. Start building Autonomous Agents. 🛑

**Body:**
Most "Data Science" projects on resumes end at a Jupyter Notebook. But in production, models need to *do* something, not just sit there.

I wanted to build a project that reflects real-world engineering standards. So I built **BankCo Intelligence**: a fully autonomous churn-prevention platform running on **Snowflake Cortex**.

🏗️ **The Architecture:**
*   **Streaming:** Live transaction data via **Kafka** (Producer/Consumer micro-services).
*   **Feature Store:** Real-time feature engineering using Snowflake **Dynamic Tables**.
*   **The Brain:** An AI Agent (Llama 3 via Cortex) that doesn't just predict churn—it *intervenes* by sending personalized retention emails automatically.
*   **The Interface:** A Streamlit app with **Text-to-SQL** capabilities (Semantic Model) for natural language queries.

This isn't just a script; it's a living system that ingests, processes, reasons, and acts in real-time.

## Option 2: The "Recruiter Bait" (Focus on "Full Stack" Value)
**Headline:** How to stand out in 2026? Build systems, not just models. 🚀

**Body:**
I often get asked, "What skills should I learn to bridge the gap between Data Engineering and AI?"

My answer: Don't just learn tools. Learn how to connect them.

I spent the weekend building an end-to-end **Agentic Data Platform** to demonstrate exactly this. It connects a high-throughput **Kafka** stream directly into **Snowflake**, where **Cortex AI** monitors customer behavior in real-time.

**The result?** A system that autonomously detects high-risk customers and generates personalized retention strategies—without human input.

**Key Tech Stack:**
✅ **Streaming Logic:** Python & Kafka (async producers)
✅ **Data Eng:** Snowflake Dynamic Tables (declarative pipelines)
✅ **AI/LLM:** Snowflake Cortex (Llama 3) & Semantic Models
✅ **UI:** Streamlit (Text-to-SQL Chatbot)

## Option 3: The "Viral/Visual" (Short & Punchy)
**Headline:** From raw logs to Autonomous AI Actions in < 5 seconds. ⚡

**Body:**
This is what "Modern Data Stack" actually looks like in practice.

I built a full real-time Churn Intelligence Platform that:
1.  Ingests live banking transactions (**Kafka**)
2.  Computes risk scores on the fly (**Snowflake Dynamic Tables**)
3.  Triggers an LLM to write glossy retention emails (**Cortex AI**)
4.  Lets me query it all in plain English (**Streamlit**)

No batch jobs. No stale data. Just a pure event-driven loop.

This project pushed me to integrate **Agentic Workflows** directly into the warehouse layer. The future of data isn't just storing it—it's acting on it.
